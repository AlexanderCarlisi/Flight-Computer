TODO List:
[x] Mode cycling: Have that automatically cycle based on verticle velocity.
[x] A command to deploy parachute, 'recovery' run based off veticle velocity, over a certain amount of time.
[x] Seperate from recovery. An abort command, too far off center (gyroscopically), or descending ^ still just deploy parachute, but in the future we may need to add more.
[ ] Status LED indication for current State.
[ ] Radio type shit
[ ] IN PROGRESS: Recording logs to a EPPROM -> SD Card. EPPROM on bread board, upload to once flight has finished, SD Card.
